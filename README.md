# Welcome to the Atom Engine Organization! 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Atom Engine**, a lightweight and customizable 2D game engine built in C++. Whether you're here to follow the development, contribute, or just explore, we're glad to have you!

## About Atom Engine 🎮
Atom Engine is a passion project aimed at creating a **simple yet powerful 2D game engine** while deepening my understanding of C++. The engine is designed to be modular, easy to use, and perfect for indie game developers or anyone interested in game development.

### Key Features (Planned) ✨
- **2D Rendering**: Support for sprites, animations, and basic physics.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed to work on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Customizable**: Modular architecture to allow for easy extensions.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API references to help you get started.

## Project Status 🚧
Atom Engine is currently in **active development**. While it’s not yet ready for public use, you can follow the progress and contribute ideas or feedback. Once it reaches a stable and feature-rich state, it will be released publicly for everyone to use and contribute to.
